### New changes
* If you have copied any apps manually into `apps` folder - remove `apps` folder or that specific apps you copied on your microSD before installing this release to avoid issues due to OFW API version update! If you using regular builds or extra pack builds (e) without your manually added apps, all included apps will be installed automatically, no extra actions needed!

**Note: To avoid issues with .dfu, prefer installing using .tgz with qFlipper, web updater or by self update package, all needed assets will be installed**

**Recommended option - Web Updater**

What means `n` or `e` in - `flipper-z-f7-update-(version)(n / e).tgz` ? - `n` means this build comes without our custom animations, only official flipper animations, 
`e` means build has extra apps pack preinstalled

Self-update package (update from microSD) - `flipper-z-f7-update-(version).zip` or download `.tgz` for mobile app / qFlipper
